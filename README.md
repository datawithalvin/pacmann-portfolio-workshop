# Indonesian Fire Hotspots Dashboard

This project is a web-based interactive dashboard that displays fire hotspots in Indonesia detected by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) during 2020 and 2023. VIIRS is an instrument on the Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20 polar-orbiting satellites from the Joint Polar Satellite System. It has a resolution of 375 meters per pixel, enabling the detection of smaller and lower-intensity fires compared to other fire-observing satellites. VIIRS also offers nighttime fire detection capabilities through its Day-Night Band.

The dashboard is built using Python's Dash framework, which is a powerful library for creating analytical web applications. The dashboard also leverages the Plotly library for creating interactive and responsive visualizations.

## Features
- Filter the data by year to observe trends and changes in fire hotspots over time.
- Visualize the top 10 cities and provinces with the highest number of fire hotspots.
- Explore the distribution of fire hotspots across Indonesia with a density map.
- Analyze daily fire hotspots data using a line chart.
- Examine the proportion of fire hotspots by confidence level.
